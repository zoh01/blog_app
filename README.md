## 🛠️ My Approach
### Development Philosophy
The Blog App was built with a focus on creating the best possible experience for both writers and readers. Every feature was carefully considered to ensure it adds value without adding complexity.

### Architecture Pattern
The application follows Clean Architecture principles with BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management, ensuring separation of concerns and testability.
